## Who am I

My name is Isaiah Carrington, your above average Otaku and an Aspiring Python developer. 
My dream is to eventually get into and gain a level of mastery over Machine Learning and AI creation and za warudo exists to be flexed on by me.

## What I like?

I love anime, programming, reading, interacting with others, and learning as much as I can about everything that interests me.

## Current Project
Optimization on my discord bots

## Sad fact
Laptop broke... so no more dev :(
