## Who am I

My name is Isaiah Carrington, your above average Otaku and an Aspiring Python developer. 
My dream is to eventually get into and gain a level of mastery over Machine Learning and AI creation and I exist to flex on za warudo.

## What I like?

I love anime, programming, reading, interacting with others, and learning as much as I can about everything that interests me.

## Current Project

Currently, I'm working on my Discord Bot Isaiah's Parade, which you can see in my Pinned Repos.
