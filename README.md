# About me

Isaiah / Ishmael here 🙋🏾‍♂️

I'm a caribbean developer with a love of pineapples, automation and all things Python. 
I specialize in full stack development, with an interest in learning new skills continously.

Currently, working on a web game called Fight Parade, and a dating app called Cave Mate :D
Take care of me 🙏🏾
