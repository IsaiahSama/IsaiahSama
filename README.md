## Who am I

My name is Isaiah Carrington, your above average Otaku and an Aspiring Python developer.

## What I like?

I love anime, programming, reading, interacting with others, and learning as much as I can about everything that interests me.

## Current Project

Currently, working on a customizable bot to join google meetings in timed succession using Selenium, Pyautogui and Tkinter
